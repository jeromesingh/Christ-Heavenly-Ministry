  <p class="bible">Matthew 1:21 KJV  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
  their sins.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">John 1:29 KJV  The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
  sin of the world.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >1 John 2:1-2 KJV  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an
  advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  (2)  And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
  only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

</p>

<p class="bible">Jeremiah 17:12 KJV  A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.

</p>

<h5>God;s Promise</h5>

<p class="bible">Genesis 3:15 KJV  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise
thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

  </p>

<p class="bible" >1 Peter 1:18-21 KJV  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;  (19)  But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
lamb without blemish and without spot:  (20)  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
manifest in these last times for you,  (21)  Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave
him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 13:8 KJV  And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of
life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Timothy 2:13-15 KJV  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  (14)  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being
deceived was in the transgression.  (15)  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith
and charity and holiness with sobriety.

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 25:8-9 KJV  And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.  (9)  According to all that I shew
thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 25:40 KJV  And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 1:14 KJV  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 8:1-5 KJV  Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on
the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;  (2)  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.  (3)  For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.  (4)  For if he were on earth, he should not be
a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:  (5)  Who serve unto the example and
shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he,
that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 4:14 KJV  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
let us hold fast our profession.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 5:1-6 KJV  For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he
may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  (2)  Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of
the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.  (3)  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people,
so also for himself, to offer for sins.  (4)  And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God,
as was Aaron.  (5)  So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art
my Son, to day have I begotten thee.  (6)  As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
of Melchisedec.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 13:27-34 KJV  For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of
the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.  (28)  And though they found
no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.  (29)  And when they had fulfilled all that
was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.  (30)  But God raised him from the
dead:  (31)  And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses
unto the people.  (32)  And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
 (33)  God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written
in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.  (34)  And as concerning that he raised him up from
the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 2:14-16 KJV  But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and
all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  (15)  For these are not drunken, as ye
suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.  (16)  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 2:22-26 KJV  Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and
wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  (23)  Him, being delivered by
the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  (24) 
Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
 (25)  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I
should not be moved:  (26)  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in
hope:

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 2:31-36 KJV  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither
his flesh did see corruption.  (32)  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  (33)  Therefore being
by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
this, which ye now see and hear.  (34)  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said
unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  (35)  Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  (36)  Therefore let all the house
of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 110:1 KJV <b>A Psalm of David.</b> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies
thy footstool.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 110:4 KJV  The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 5:46-47 KJV  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  (47)  But if ye believe not
his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

</p>
<br>

<h5>The Old and New</h5>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 9:1-7 KJV  Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.  (2) 
For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is
called the sanctuary.  (3)  And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;  (4)  Which
had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had
manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;  (5)  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing
the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.  (6)  Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests
went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.  (7)  But into the second went the high priest
alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 29:33-35 KJV  And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify
them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.  (34)  And if ought of the flesh of the
consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be
eaten, because it is holy.  (35)  And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I
have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.

<p class="text ">Hebrews 9:1-2 tells us about the Holy place while verses 3-4 tells us about the Most Holy place.</p>

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 17:11 KJV  For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an
atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 29:38-39 KJV  Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day
continually.  (39)  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 30:1 KJV  And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 30:6-8 KJV  And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that
is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.  (7)  And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.  (8)  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

</p>

<p class="bible">Luke 1:8-10 KJV  And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,
 (9)  According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the
Lord.  (10)  And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 9:6-7 KJV  Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle,
accomplishing the service of God.  (7)  But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without
blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:

</p>
<br>
<h5>Day of Atonement</h5>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:2 KJV  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the
holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud
upon the mercy seat.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:16 KJV  And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:19 KJV  And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow
it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.


</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:32-34 KJV  And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's
office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:
 (33)  And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
congregation.  (34)  And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel
for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 23:26-32 KJV  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  (27)  Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there
shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD.  (28)  And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to
make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.  (29)  For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.  (30)  And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.  (31)  Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for
ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.  (32)  It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall
afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 13:10-12 KJV  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  (11)  For the
bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the
camp.  (12)  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 1:9-18 KJV  I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience
of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
 (10)  I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,  (11)  Saying, I am
Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches
which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.  (12)  And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven
golden candlesticks;  (13)  And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a
garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.  (14)  His head and his hairs were white like
wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;  (15)  And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they
burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.  (16)  And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out
of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.  (17)  And when I
saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and
the last:  (18)  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of
hell and of death.
